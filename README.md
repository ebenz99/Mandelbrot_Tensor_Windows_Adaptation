# Mandelbrot_Tensor_Windows_Adaptation
A Tensorflow Mandelbrot tutorial adapted to work for Windows

TensorFlow is a software library created by Google for numerical computation and machine learning. It can be hard to pick up as an amateur programmer, but a tutorial is available at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mandelbrot for Linux and Mac users. I've attempted to adapt that tutorial for those working with Windows and Windows command line software.

**Prerequisites:**
	
	*Python 3.5.2
		
		*If you have a different version of python installed, this tutorial may work for you, but it also may not. I would recommend downloading the 'Windows x86-64 executable installer' from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/. Once this is installed, add the directory where the python 3.5.2 executable is located to the top of your PATH (can be found by editing environment variables)
		
		*Check this step by opening a NEW terminal window and entering the command 'python -V'. Among other things, it should display your python version as Python 3.5.2

	*Up-to-date Pip
		
		*With this version of Python, you probably have a pip around version 8. Get the most current version by entering the command 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip'
